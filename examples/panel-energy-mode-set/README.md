## High voltage Energy Storage Mode Set Template

This template is developed based on the Ray framework and is provided to business developers who need to develop panels in apps such as Tuya Smart and Smart Life. The code offers basic usage methods for Ray development, including routing usage, page navigation, device operations, multi-language support, and more. Developers can refer to examples and adjust the code according to their business requirements.

### Quick Start:

1. Go to the [IoT platform](https://iot.tuya.com/) to create a product.

2. Choose the category `Energy - Energy Storage & Stored`.

3. Functions selection

   Custom Functions

   ```
   work_mode - String
   charger_switch - Bool
   discharge_switch - Bool
   time_schedule - Raw
   ```

4. Install project and start project

   ```
   yarn && yarn start
   ```

## Component Usage

When developing using the Ray framework, if you want to support multi-terminal solutions, you need to use the components provided by the Ray framework. For specifics, refer to the [Ray component document](https://developer.tuya.com/cn/ray/components).

## Basic Operations and API

The Ray framework provides plenty of APIs for business to directly call. These APIs have been made compatible with various platforms, so developers no longer need to differentiate platform code at runtime. For details, refer to the [API documentation](https://developer.tuya.com/cn/ray/api/authorize).

## Device Operations

To meet panel development needs, the Ray framework also provides device operation-related APIs. When developers need to operate devices, they can directly use the device operation capabilities provided by the framework. For specifics, refer to [API documentation - Device-related capabilities](https://developer.tuya.com/cn/ray/api/device-kit/add-timer).

## Component Extension

If the components provided by the Ray framework do not meet business requirements well, it is possible to develop and extend components following the premise of [cross-platform adaptation](https://developer.tuya.com/cn/ray/guide/tutorial/env). The styles in components need to follow the [style rules](https://developer.tuya.com/cn/ray/guide/tutorial/stylesheet).

## Panel SDK

We have encapsulated some methods needed for panel development. You can directly use the capabilities provided by the methods. For details, refer to [Panel SDK](https://developer.tuya.com/cn/ray/panel).

## Multi-Language

The multi-language used in the panel template includes product multi-language and UI multi-language. You can directly use them in the business. For specifics, refer to [Multi-Language](https://developer.tuya.com/cn/ray/panel/i18n/i18n). If this library does not meet business requirements, developers can extend the multi-language solution based on the `getLangKey` and `getLangContent` provided by Ray API.

## Capability Division Packages

In the Ray framework, device control, basic app capabilities, Tuya-specific capabilities, etc., all require support from [capability packages](https://developer.tuya.com/en/miniapp/common/desc/api#kit-capability-packages). The template defaults add the four major capability collections: BaseKit, BizKit, MiniKit, DeviceKit. Developers can manage according to their needs. Also, refer to [API capability integration guide](https://developer.tuya.com/en/miniapp/common/desc/api) for adjustments.
